Yoou can have a common summary outside of any tag,
but you can use tag to be abble to filter a special part / theme of your text.

<tag>

 and access to it even when you forget, use it !
<tag/>

There is no limit with tag.

<tag2> 

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 | 
| X    |   O  |   O  |
|   O  |   X  |   O  |
|  o   |   O  |   X  |

If you don't like the "__/@@" , you can modify it in config !

__/@@ Demo

<important>

if you want to add a new date , you have to call back your file with __/@@ MyFile

Don't forget to close your files with @@/

<important/>

<rules>

Everything you do here is not save till you don't. if you trigger a filter, your text area will be reset (save before changing the layout).

Each edition should start by a date followed by a section/File, if you dont close your file the export will not work.

You can overlap tag, but play with it too understand what it mean. 

<rules/>

<bestUseAdvice>
You should have a folder JDB 'journalDeBord' for basic think which is not tag to a project.
You should use tag if you want to be able to filter something fast.
you should create your own shortuct for something natural and pleasant to use (config, dont worry it will remap your file - usefull if you need a clean print - for a prompt by example) .
YOU SHOULD ADD THIS FOLDER IN A GIT REPOSITORY FOR VERSIONING : ONE COMMIT EVERY DAY (automaticaly? 😊)
